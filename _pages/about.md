<div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 20px;">
I am a PhD candidate in The University of Queensland, supervised by <a href="https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/33027" target="_blank">Prof. David Ascher</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UaA7NQsAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Stephanie Portelli</a>, and <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=tHGepncAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate" target="_blank">Dr. Thanh-Binh Nguyen</a>. I have a broad interest in bioinformatics, particularly molecular modelling, mutation analysis, and machine learning. Though I started as a wet-lab biologist in my undergraduate study, I always encouraged myself to embrace new knowledge and skills. I then decided to start a new journey overseas, and went to Melbourne for the Master study, where I met my current lovely lab members.

Currently, my PhD projects focus on

<div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 5px;">
  <ul>
    <li><b>Evaluating the performance of computational tools to estimate the effect of missense mutations on protein structures, stability, and ligand binding</b>, and </li>
    <li><b>How to leverage the computational programs and machine learning to better charactersise the effect of missense variants towards pathogenic phenotypes</b>.</li>
  </ul>

In my spare time, I like photography, cycling, video games, grocery shopping, etc.
