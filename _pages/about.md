<div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 20px;">
I am a PhD candidate in The University of Queensland, supervised by <a href="https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/33027" target="_blank">Prof. David Ascher</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UaA7NQsAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Stephanie Portelli</a>, and <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=tHGepncAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate" target="_blank">Dr. Thanh-Binh Nguyen</a>. I have a broad interest in bioinformatics, particularly in molecular modelling, human variant analysis, and machine learning. Though I started as a wet-lab biologist in my undergraduate study in China, I always encouraged myself to learn new knowledge and skills. I then decided to start a new journey overseas, and first went to Melbourne for the Master study, where I met my current lovely lab members, followed by a doctoral study in Brisbane.

Currently, my PhD projects focus on answering the questions like:
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 5px;">
  <ul>
    <li><b>Can we use AI-generated protein structures to study mutations and the corresponding phenotypes ?</b>
    </li>
    <li><b>How can we leverage the computational methods and interpretable machine learning to better charactersise the effect of missense variants towards pathogenic phenotypes ?</b></li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 5px;">
I am pretty ambitious. Now I am trying to obtain fundings such as fellowship to support my post-doc research.

Personally, I like photography, cycling, video games, grocery shopping, etc.
