Starting as a wet-lab person in the undergraduate study, Qisheng worked on neuroinflammation and anxiety-like behaviour on mice using molecular experiments and behavioural tests. After that, concerning the laboratory condition may not be suitable for his skin health, he started a new journey in dry-lab work. He studied bioinformatics in his master degree, where he met his current supervisors, <a href="https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/33027" target="_blank">Prof. David Ascher</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UaA7NQsAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Stephanie Portelli</a>, and <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=tHGepncAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate" target="_blank">Dr. Thanh-Binh Nguyen</a>. With strong self-motivation, Qisheng studied programming and Linux command-line by himself, which built a solid foundation for his later research projects on molecular modelling and machine learning-based mutation analysis.

Qisheng Pan has a broad interest in computational biology. Currently, his PhD projects focus on 
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 5px;">
  <ul>
    <li><b>evaluating the performance of computational tools to estimate the effect of missense mutations on protein structures, stability, and ligand binding</b>, and </li>
    <li><b>how to leverage the computational programs and machine learning to better charactersise the effect of missense variants towards pathogenic phenotypes</b>.</li>
  </ul>

<div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 20px;">
In addition to his research projects, Qisheng is also keen on <a href="/talks/">scientific presentations</a>.
