Starting as a wet-lab person, his thesis of his bachelor degree present the investigation of the regulation of the expression of inflammatory cytokins in the microglia cells caused by the knock out of the *Cyld* gene, and their relationship with anxiety-like behaviours in mice. After that, concerning the laboratory condition may not be suitable for his skin health, he started a new journey in dry-lab work. He studied bioinformatic analysis in his master degree, where he met his current supervisor, Prof. David Ascher. With strong self-motivation, Qisheng studied programming and Linux command-line, which built a solid foundation for his later research projects on molecular modelling and machine learning-based mutation analysis.

Qisheng Pan has a broad interest in computational biology. Currently, his PhD projects focus on 
1. evaluating the performance of computational tools to estimate the effect of missense mutations on protein structures, and 
2. how to leverage the computational programs and machine learning to better annotate the effect of missense variants towards pathogenic phenotypes. 

In addition to his research projects, Qisheng is also keen on scientific presentations, which brought him several clinical collaborations of the annotation of missense variants using computational biophysical measurments. 

Meanwhile, he has experiences in mentoring undergrad and master students to provide guidance on their research projects.
